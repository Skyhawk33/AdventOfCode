# Advent of Code solutions

This is a collection of solutions for the annual puzzle event at https://adventofcode.com/

## 2023
This year I have been solving the puzzles in [Befunge-98](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Funge-98),
running in the [PyFunge](https://pythonhosted.org/PyFunge/index.html) interpreter.

You will need Python 2.7 because the interpreter hasn't been updated since 2009.
